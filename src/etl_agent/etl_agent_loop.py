         I am using bauplan and I need to load the parquet files in this bucket, with public reads available: s3://public-bucket.  Documentation for bauplan is available at online: you can use web tools to find what you are looking for.  I need to use the write-audit-publish (WAP) pattern, to safely import the data into tables - one file per table -  and I need to run a quality check at the end of the import. Use the concepts and APIs specific to bauplan to accomplish this:  for example, bauplan might support concepts like namespaces, clones, data branches etc., which are some of the ways WAP is done.  You do NOT have to use all of these concepts, but you can use them if they are available in the platform.  If a table already exists, you can replace it using the platform-specific APIs, like deletion, replacement etc. At the end of the import, use the platform APIs to run a query and check that the id column in every table just imported have no null values.  Generate a Python script that uses the secrets  to access bauplan. Make sure to catch any exceptions and print them to the console so that we can debug the code if it fails.  If you need to use any other libraries, make sure to import them as well.  Do NOT output anything that is not the Python code itself.
